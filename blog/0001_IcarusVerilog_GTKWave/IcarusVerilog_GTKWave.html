Verilog Simulation</h1>

<p>This is a repost of a blog post I made on medium sometime back.</p>
<p>Hardware Description Languages (HDLs) are employed to define the
operations of electronic and digital systems. Verilog is a notable
example. In the industry, other frequently utilized HDLs include VHDL
and SystemVerilog, which serve dual purposes for both design and
verification. Additionally, there are less widely recognized but still
effective HDLs like Chisel (built on Scala), Hardcaml (built on OCaml),
and cocotb, which is commonly utilized for creating testbenches for
VHDL, SystemVerilog, and Verilog in Python.</p>
<p>In this tutorial, we are going to install Icarus Verilog and GTKWave,
then as an example, write a multiplexer and its testbench in
Verilog.</p>
<h1 id="installing-icarus-verilog">Installing Icarus Verilog</h1>
<p>Icarus Verilog is an open source compiler for the Verilog HDL.</p>
<p>Update Ubuntu package list, then install Icarus Verilog using the apt
install command</p>
<pre class="bash"><code>sudo apt update
sudo apt install iverilog</code></pre>
<h1 id="installing-gtkwave">Installing GTKWave</h1>
<p>GTKWave is a waveform viewer that seamlessly works with Icarus
Verilog to display simulation results. It is conveniently available in
Ubuntu‚Äôs apt package list, therefore we will use the
<code>apt install</code> command once more.</p>
<pre class="bash"><code>sudo apt install gtkwave</code></pre>
<p>With both Icarus Verilog and GTKWave installed, we are going to
create a simple Verilog project to verify and test their
functionality.</p>
<h1 id="creating-a-multiplexer-in-verilog">Creating a Multiplexer in
Verilog</h1>
<p>A multiplexer is a combinational logic circuit that‚Äôs used to select
only one input from several inputs based on selection lines. In most
cases there usually are 2^n input lines and n selection lines whose
combinations determine which input is selected.</p>
<p>Our project will be a 2x1 multiplexer. It therefore has 2 input lines
and one select line.</p>

<p>Below is the truth table for the above 2x1 Multiplexer. When S=0,
output will be switched to in1 input, then when S=1, output will be
switched to in2 output.</p>

<p>Now that we have some context about the 2x1 multiplexer, we‚Äôll
proceed to implement it in Verilog and develop a testbench to simulate
its behavior.</p>
<p>Organizing our files is a great practice. Here‚Äôs how we can navigate
to the <code>Documents</code> directory, create a
<code>DigitalDesign</code> folder, and then create a
<code>Multiplexer_2_1</code> folder within it, assuming we‚Äôre starting
from the home directory:</p>
<pre class="bash"><code>cd Documents
mkdir DigitalDesign
cd DigitalDesign
mkdir Multiplexer_2_1
cd Multiplexer_2_1</code></pre>
<p>Now, within the <code>Multiplexer_2_1</code> folder located in the
<code>DigitalDesign</code> directory, we‚Äôre ready to implement our
Verilog project. We‚Äôll use the nano text editor to create a Verilog file
for the multiplexer.</p>
<pre class="bash"><code>nano multiplexer_2_1.v</code></pre>
<p>Below is the Verilog code for the multiplexer. I recommend typing the
code out by yourself while following along.</p>
<pre class="verilog"><code>module multiplexer_2_1(
  input a,
  input b,
  input select,
  output y
);

assign y = (select)?b:a;
endmodule</code></pre>
<p>Save the file(Ctrl+O+Enter) and exit(Ctrl+X) the text editor</p>
<p>Now we are going to write the testbench</p>
<pre class="bash"><code>nano multiplexer_2_1_tb.v</code></pre>
<p>Below is the Verilog testbench</p>
<pre class="verilog"><code>`timescale 1ns/100ps 
module multiplexer_2_1_tb;

 //inputs
 reg a, b, select;
 //outputs
 wire y;

 multiplexer_2_1 u0_DUT(
  .a(a),
  .b(b),
  .select(select),
  .y(y)
 );

 //initialize inputs

 initial begin
//simulation files dumped to the test_2_1mux file
  $dumpfile(&quot;test_2_1mux.vcd&quot;);
  $dumpvars(0,multiplexer_2_1_tb);
  a=1&#39;b0;b=1&#39;b0; select=1&#39;b0;
  #5 a=1&#39;b1; 
  #5 select = 1&#39;b1;
  #5 b=1&#39;b1;
  #5 a=1&#39;b0;
  #5 $finish;
 end
endmodule</code></pre>
<p>Once we have saved and closed the file we can now use Icarus Verilog
to compile our sources.</p>
<pre class="bash"><code>iverilog -o mux_wave_2_1 multiplexer_2_1.v multiplexer_tb_2_1.v</code></pre>
<p>Using the <code>ls</code> command we will see a new file by the name
<code>mux_wave_2_1</code> produced when our sources are compiled. To run
it we are going to use the <code>vvp</code> command, commonly associated
with iverilog as its simulation runtime engine, which will produce
another file by the name <code>test_2_1mux.vcd</code> as defined in our
testbench code.</p>
<pre class="bash"><code>vvp mux_wave_2_1</code></pre>
<p>To view the waveform, we are going to use GTKWave. GTKWave allows we
to interactively explore and analyze the waveform data generated by our
Verilog simulations, making it a key tool for debugging and
understanding the behavior of our designs.</p>
<pre class="bash"><code>gtkwave test_2_1mux.vcd</code></pre>
<p>A GTKWave window will appear.</p>

<p>Select the Appropriate Module: In the left panel of the GTKWave
window, we will see a list of modules. Look for the module associated
with our simulation, which in this case is likely named
‚Äúmultiplexer_2_1_tb.‚Äù It will be represented with a tree-like icon.</p>
<p>Select Signals to View: In the module tree, select the signals we
want to view in the bottom panel. To do this, simply click on the
signals one by one in the order we‚Äôd like to view them. They will appear
in the bottom panel.</p>
<p>Display Waveforms: Once we‚Äôve selected the signals, the main waveform
window will populate itself with the selected signals. We will see the
waveforms representing the behavior of these signals over time.</p>
<p>Adjust the Scale: We can adjust the scale of the waveform to better
visualize changes. Use the zoom in and zoom out icons or the scaling
options in the GTKWave toolbar to zoom in or out until we can clearly
see the waveform changes.</p>

<p>At 5ns: The input a becomes 1, and as a result, the output y also
becomes 1 because the select pin is set to 0, meaning it selects input
a.</p>
<p>At 10ns: The select pin is set to 1, causing the multiplexer to
switch its selection to input b. Consequently, y drops to 0 because it
now reflects the value of b.</p>
<p>At 15ns: Input b becomes 1, causing the output y to change to 1 since
the multiplexer is still selecting input b due to the earlier set select
value.</p>
<p>At 20ns: Input a becomes 0, but it doesn‚Äôt affect the output y at
this point since the select pin remains at 1, continuing to select input
b. Thus, y remains at 1.</p>
<p>We can modify the testbench variables then re-run the simulation
followed by the accompanying steps to observe how our changes affect the
waveform.</p>

<p>My inspiration for this project and writing came from Raul Behl‚Äôs
‚Äú100 Days of RTL,‚Äù where he employed SystemVerilog. Throughout this
endeavor, he undertook progressively complex projects as the days
advanced. I hope to do the same, probably not in 100 DaysüòÇ</p>
<p>Our next project will be a D flip-flop.</p>
<p>Thank you!</p>
