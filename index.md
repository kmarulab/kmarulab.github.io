Welcome to my personal blog. My core focus is 5G/6G communications, and DSP, with hands-on work in lab automation (SCPI), measurement, and prototyping on PYNQ, MATLAB, Python, C++ and CUDA.

I’m a senior at Swarthmore College (Engineering & Applied Mathematics) and recently worked in Prof. Alyosha Molnar’s lab at Cornell on RF receiver front-end characterization; previously I contributed at Kaizen Electronics and Jamii Telecom.

I enjoy tinkering with sdrs and fpgas, and I'm currently exploring a localization project for my engineering capstone. I'll document the entire process. I recently picked up crossfit training and hopefully we'll see some gains pretty soon.

Huge thanks to [Michael Waltz](https://x.com/junocake). My website is based on his edited version of [solar-theme-jekyll](https://github.com/mattvh/solar-theme-jekyll).
