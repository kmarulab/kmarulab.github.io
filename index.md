## About Me
Hello, my name is Kimaru Boruett; I am an international student from Kenya at Swarthmore College. I have an academic background and relevant course experience in Electrical Engineering and Applied Mathematics, backed by great internship experiences with Jamii Telecommunications Limited and Kaizen Electronics Limited both in Kenya. In these places, I have been able to work on network systems optimization, the creation of stable firmware for embedded systems, and the administration of power control in energy systems. I would like to grow a career in research and development, specifically in Analog Mixed-Signal IC Design. With my proficiency in C/C++, Python, Matlab, and familiarity with various engineering tools, I have always been keen on being part of such a team that undertakes difficult projects to bring in newer and better technologies that elevate user experiences. I look forward to bringing my technical expertise into innovative work that can make a difference in the field.

Other than sinking deep into code or grinding on engineering homework, you'll find me at Swarthmore's Ware Pool. Currently, I am working on comfortably doing a 200m medley by the end of the semester. I'm a massive fan of English football, and an avid supporter of Arsenal Football Club; I really think we're gonna win it this season. I also like photography because I find it cool to freeze those perfect moments and nice sceneries with my camera. All in all, I'm all about adventure, always looking for new experiences and challenges that make life more exciting.

## Experience
<p></p>
* **Jamii Telecommunications Limited (Jun 2024-Aug 2024)**
    - Optimized GSM and LTE networks, improving KPIs such as Mobility, Accessibility, Retainability, and Service Integrity, resulting in an enhancement in overall network QoS and User Experience (UX)
    - Conducted network capacity dimensioning, successfully mitigating capacity bottlenecks, contributing to an increase in network capacity utilization
    -  Resolved network and service degradations, ensuring 99.5% uptime through proactive troubleshooting and escalations to relevant teams
    - Resolved customer complaints through physical network optimizations and enhancing coverage in low signal regions through re-positioning antennas, adding base-stations and adjusting signal levels
<p></p>
* **Kaizen Electronics Limited (May 2023-Aug 2023)**
