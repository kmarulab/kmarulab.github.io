Welcome to my personal website. My core focus is 5G/6G communications, and DSP, with hands-on work in lab automation (SCPI), measurement, and prototyping on PYNQ, MATLAB, Python, C++ and CUDA.

I am a senior at Swarthmore College majoring in Engineering and Applied Mathematics. Most recently, I worked in Professor Alyosha Molnarâ€™s lab at Cornell University, characterizing RF receiver front-ends. Earlier, I gained industry experience at at Jamii Telecom, assisting with network engineering and operations, and at Kaizen Electronics, contributing to embedded-hardware projects.

I enjoy tinkering with SDRs and FPGAs, and I'm currently exploring a localization project for my engineering capstone. I'll document the entire process. Outside work, I recently picked up crossfit training and hopefully we'll see some gains pretty soon.

Huge thanks to [Michael Waltz](https://x.com/junocake). My website is based on his edited version of [solar-theme-jekyll](https://github.com/mattvh/solar-theme-jekyll).
